</div>

<p>This document is a modified version of a document from a committee formed at
AT&amp;T's Indian Hill labs to establish a common set of coding standards and
recommendations for the Indian Hill community. The scope of this work is C
coding style. Good style should encourage consistent layout, improve
portability, and reduce errors. This work does not cover functional
organization, or general issues such as the use of <span class=
"emphasis"><em>goto</em></span>s. We( The opinions in this document do not
reflect the opinions of all authors. This is still an evolving document. Please
send comments and suggestions to pardo@cs.washington.edu or
{rutgers,cornell,ucsd,ubc-cs,tektronix}!uw-beaver!june!pardo) have tried to
combine previous work [1,6,8] on C style into a uniform set of standards that
should be appropriate for any project using C, although parts are biased
towards particular systems. Of necessity, these standards cannot cover all
situations. Experience and informed judgement count for much. Programmers who
encounter unusual situations should consult either experienced C programmers or
code written by experienced C programmers (preferably following these
rules).</p>

<p>The standards in this document are not of themselves required, but
individual institutions or groups may adopt part or all of them as a part of
program acceptance. It is therefore likely that others at your institution will
code in a similar style. Ultimately, the goal of these standards is to increase
portability, reduce maintenance, and above all improve clarity.</p>

<p>Many of the style choices here are somewhat arbitrary. Mixed coding style is
harder to maintain than bad coding style. When changing existing code it is
better to conform to the style (indentation, spacing, commenting, naming
conventions) of the existing code than it is to blindly follow this
document.</p>

<div class="titlepage">
<h2 class="title c3"><a name="N1007C" id="N1007C"></a>File Organization</h2>
</div>

<p>A file consists of various sections that should be separated by several
blank lines. Although there is no maximum length limit for source files, files
with more than about 1000 lines are cumbersome to deal with. The editor may not
have enough temp space to edit the file, compilations will go more slowly, etc.
Many rows of asterisks, for example, present little information compared to the
time it takes to scroll past, and are discouraged. Lines longer than 79 columns
are not handled well by all terminals and should be avoided if possible.
Excessively long lines which result from deep indenting are often a symptom of
poorly-organized code.</p>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h3 class="title"><a name="N10081" id="N10081"></a>File Naming Conventions</h3>
</div>

<p>File names are made up of a base name, and an optional period and suffix.
The first character of the name should be a letter and all characters (except
the period) should be lower-case letters and numbers. The base name should be
eight or fewer characters and the suffix should be three or fewer characters
(four, if you include the period). These rules apply to both program files and
default files used and produced by the program (e.g., "rogue.sav").</p>

<p>Some compilers and tools require certain suffix conventions for names of
files [5]. The following suffixes are required:</p>

<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>C source file names must end in <code class="filename">.c</code></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Assembler source file names must end in <code class="filename">.s</code></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The following conventions are universally followed:</p>

<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="circle">
<li>
<p>Relocatable object file names end in <code class="filename">.o</code></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Include header file names end in <code class="filename">.h</code>. An
alternate convention that may be preferable in multi-language environments is
to suffix both the language type and <code class="filename">.h</code> (e.g.
<code class="filename">foo.c.h</code>; or <code class=
"filename">foo.ch</code>).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Yacc source file names end in <code class="filename">.y</code></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Lex source file names end in <code class="filename">.l</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<p>C++ has compiler-dependent suffix conventions, including <code class=
"filename">.c</code>, <code class="filename">..c</code>, <code class=
"filename">.cc</code>, <code class="filename">.c.c</code>, and <code class=
"filename">.C</code>. Since much C code is also C++ code, there is no clear
solution here.</p>

<p>In addition, it is conventional to use <code class=
"filename">Makefile</code> (not <code class="filename">makefile</code>) for the
control file for <span class="command"><strong>make</strong></span> (for
systems that support it) and "README" for a summary of the contents of the
directory or directory tree.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h3 class="title"><a name="N100D8" id="N100D8"></a>Program Files</h3>
</div>

<p>The suggested order of sections for a program file is as follows</p>

<div class="orderedlist">
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>First in the file is a prologue that tells what is in that file. A
description of the purpose of the objects in the files (whether they be
functions, external data declarations or definitions, or something else) is
more useful than a list of the object names. The prologue may optionally
contain author(s), revision control information, references, etc.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Any header file includes should be next. If the include is for a non-obvious
reason, the reason should be commented. In most cases, system include files
like <code class="filename">stdio.h</code> should be included before user
include files.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Any defines and typedefs that apply to the file as a whole are next. One
normal order is to have "constant" macros first, then "function" macros, then
typedefs and enums.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Next come the global (external) data declarations, usually in the order:
externs, non-static globals, static globals. If a set of defines applies to a
particular piece of global data (such as a flags word), the defines should be
immediately after the data declaration or embedded in structure declarations,
indented to put the defines one level deeper than the first keyword of the
declaration to which they apply.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The functions come last, and should be in some sort of meaningful order.
Like functions should appear together. A "breadth-first" approach (functions on
a similar level of abstraction together) is preferred over depth-first
(functions defined as soon as possible before or after their calls).
Considerable judgement is called for here. If defining large numbers of
essentially-independent utility functions, consider alphabetical order.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h3 class="title"><a name="N100F0" id="N100F0"></a>Header Files</h3>
</div>

<p>Header files are files that are included in other files prior to compilation
by the C preprocessor. Some, such as <code class="filename">stdio.h</code>, are
defined at the system level and must included by any program using the standard
I/O library. Header files are also used to contain data declarations and
defines that are needed by more than one program. Header files should be
functionally organized, i.e., declarations for separate subsystems should be in
separate header files. Also, if a set of declarations is likely to change when
code is ported from one machine to another, those declarations should be in a
separate header file.</p>

<p>Avoid private header filenames that are the same as library header
filenames. The statement <code class="code">#include</code> <code class=
"filename">"math.h"</code> will include the standard library math header file
if the intended one is not found in the current directory. If this is what you
<span class="emphasis"><em>want</em></span> to happen, comment this fact. Don't
use absolute pathnames for header files. Use the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>&lt;name&gt;</em></span> construction for getting them from a
standard place, or define them relative to the current directory. The
"include-path" option of the C compiler (-I on many systems) is the best way to
handle extensive private libraries of header files; it permits reorganizing the
directory structure without having to alter source files.</p>

<p>Header files that declare functions or external variables should be included
in the file that defines the function or variable. That way, the compiler can
do type checking and the external declaration will always agree with the
definition.</p>

<p>Defining variables in a header file is often a poor idea. Frequently it is a
symptom of poor partitioning of code between files. Also, some objects like
typedefs and initialized data definitions cannot be seen twice by the compiler
in one compilation. On some systems, repeating uninitialized declarations
without the <code class="code">extern</code> keyword also causes problems.
Repeated declarations can happen if include files are nested and will cause the
compilation to fail.</p>

<p>Header files should not be nested. The prologue for a header file should,
therefore, describe what other headers need to be #included for the header to
be functional. In extreme cases, where a large number of header files are to be
included in several different source files, it is acceptable to put all common
#includes in one include file.</p>

<p>It is common to put the following into each <code class="filename">.h</code>
file to prevent accidental double-inclusion.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
    #ifndef EXAMPLE_H
      #define EXAMPLE_H
      ... <span class="emphasis"><em>/* body of example.h file */</em></span>
      #endif /* EXAMPLE_H */
    
</pre>

<p>This double-inclusion mechanism should not be relied upon, particularly to
perform nested includes.</p>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h4 class="title"><a name="N1011E" id="N1011E"></a>Other Files</h4>
</div>

<p>It is conventional to have a file called <code class=
"filename">README</code> to document both "the bigger picture" and issues for
the program as a whole. For example, it is common to include a list of all
conditional compilation flags and what they mean. It is also common to list
files that are machine dependent, etc.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h2 class="title c3"><a name="N10126" id="N10126"></a>Comments</h2>
</div>

<p>"<span class="emphasis"><em>When the code and the comments disagree, both
are probably wrong.</em></span>" -- Norm Schryer</p>

<p>The comments should describe <span class="emphasis"><em>what</em></span> is
happening, <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> it is being done, what
parameters mean, which globals are used and which are modified, and any
restrictions or bugs. Avoid, however, comments that are clear from the code, as
such information rapidly gets out of date. Comments that disagree with the code
are of negative value. Short comments should be <span class=
"emphasis"><em>what</em></span> comments, such as "compute mean value", rather
than <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> comments such as "sum of values
divided by n". C is not assembler; putting a comment at the top of a 3-10 line
section telling what it does overall is often more useful than a comment on
each line describing micrologic.</p>

<p>Comments should justify offensive code. The justification should be that
something bad will happen if unoffensive code is used. Just making code faster
is not enough to rationalize a hack; the performance must be <span class=
"emphasis"><em>shown</em></span> to be unacceptable without the hack. The
comment should explain the unacceptable behavior and describe why the hack is a
"good" fix.</p>

<p>Comments that describe data structures, algorithms, etc., should be in block
comment form with the opening <code class="literal">/*</code> in columns 1-2, a
<code class="literal">*</code> in column 2 before each line of comment text,
and the closing <code class="literal">*/</code> in columns 2-3. An alternative
is to have <code class="literal">**</code> in columns 1-2, and put the closing
<code class="literal">*/</code> also in 1-2.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   /*
    * Here is a block comment.
    * The comment text should be tabbed or spaced over uniformly.
    * The opening slash-star and closing star-slash are alone on a line.
    */
</pre>
<pre class="programlisting">
   /*
   ** Alternate format for block comments
   */
</pre>

<p>Note that <span class="emphasis"><em>grep '^.\*'</em></span> will catch all
block comments in the file.</p>

<div class="orderedlist">
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Some automated program-analysis packages use different characters before
comment lines as a marker for lines with specific items of information. In
particular, a line with a '<code class="literal">-</code>' in a comment
preceding a function is sometimes assumed to be a one-line summary of the
function's purpose. Very long block comments such as drawn-out discussions and
copyright notices often start with <code class="literal">/*</code> in columns
1-2, no leading <code class="literal">*</code> before lines of text, and the
closing <code class="literal">*/</code> in columns 1-2. Block comments inside a
function are appropriate, and they should be tabbed over to the same tab
setting as the code that they describe. One-line comments alone on a line
should be indented to the tab setting of the code that follows.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   if (argc&gt; 1) {
    /* Get input file from command line. */
    if (freopen(argv[1], "r", stdin) == NULL) {
     perror (argv[1]);
    }
   }
</pre>Very short comments may appear on the same line as the code they
describe, and should be tabbed over to separate them from the statements. If
more than one short comment appears in a block of code they should all be
tabbed to the same tab setting.
<pre class="programlisting">
   if (a == EXCEPTION) {
    b = TRUE;    /* special case */
   } else {
    b = isprime(a);   /* works only for odd a */
   }
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h2 class="title c3"><a name="N10180" id="N10180"></a>Declarations</h2>
</div>

<p>Global declarations should begin in column 1. All external data declaration
should be preceded by the <code class="code">extern</code> keyword. If an
external variable is an array that is defined with an explicit size, then the
array bounds must be repeated in the extern declaration unless the size is
always encoded in the array (e.g., a read-only character array that is always
null-terminated). Repeated size declarations are particularly beneficial to
someone picking up code written by another.</p>

<p>The "pointer" qualifier, '<code class="literal">*</code>', should be with
the variable name rather than with the type.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   char  *s, *t, *u;
</pre>instead of
<pre class="programlisting">
   char* s, t, u;
</pre>which is wrong, since '<code class="varname">t</code>' and '<code class=
"varname">u</code>' do not get declared as pointers.

<p>Unrelated declarations, even of the same type, should be on separate lines.
A comment describing the role of the object being declared should be included,
with the exception that a list of <code class="code">#define</code>d constants
do not need comments if the constant names are sufficient documentation. The
names, values, and comments are usually tabbed so that they line up underneath
each other. Use the tab character rather than blanks (spaces). For structure
and union template declarations, each element should be alone on a line with a
comment describing it. The opening brace (<code class="code">{</code>) should
be on the same line as the structure tag, and the closing brace (<code class=
"code">}</code>) should be in column 1.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   struct boat {
    int  wllength; /* water line length in meters */
    int  type;  /* see below */
    long  sailarea; /* sail area in square mm */
   };
   /* defines for boat.type */
   #define KETCH (1)
   #define YAWL  (2)
   #define SLOOP (3)
   #define SQRIG (4)
   #define MOTOR (5)
</pre>These defines are sometimes put right after the declaration of
<code class="literal">type</code>, within the <code class=
"literal">struct</code> declaration, with enough tabs after the '<code class=
"literal">#</code>' to indent <code class="literal">define</code> one level
more than the structure member declarations. When the actual values are
unimportant, the <span class="emphasis"><em>enum</em></span> facility is
better.

<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>enum</em></span>s might be better anyway.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   
enum bt { KETCH=1, YAWL, SLOOP, SQRIG, MOTOR };
   struct boat {
    int  wllength; /* water line length in meters */
    enum bt type;  /* what kind of boat */
    long  sailarea; /* sail area in square mm */
   };
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Any variable whose initial value is important should be <span class=
"emphasis"><em>explicitly</em></span> initialized, or at the very least should
be commented to indicate that C's default initialization to zero is being
relied upon. The empty initializer, "<code class="literal">{}</code>", should
never be used. Structure initializations should be fully parenthesized with
braces. Constants used to initialize longs should be explicitly long. Use
capital letters; for example two long "<code class="literal">2l</code>" looks a
lot like "<code class="literal">21</code>", the number twenty-one.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   int  x = 1;
   char  *msg = "message";
   struct boat winner[] = {
    { 40, YAWL, 6000000L },
    { 28, MOTOR, 0L },
    { 0 },
   };
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>In any file which is part of a larger whole rather than a self-contained
program, maximum use should be made of the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>static</em></span> keyword to make functions and variables local
to single files. Variables in particular should be accessible from other files
only when there is a clear need that cannot be filled in another way. Such
usage should be commented to make it clear that another file's variables are
being used; the comment should name the other file. If your debugger hides
static objects you need to see during debugging, declare them as <code class=
"literal">STATIC</code> and #define <code class="literal">STATIC</code> as
needed.</p>

<p>The most important types should be highlighted by typedeffing them, even if
they are only integers, as the unique name makes the program easier to read (as
long as there are only a <span class="emphasis"><em>few</em></span> things
typedeffed to integers!). Structures may be typedeffed when they are declared.
Give the struct and the typedef the same name.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
 
  typedef struct splodge_t {
    int sp_count;
    char *sp_name, *sp_alias;
   } splodge_t;
</pre>

<p>The return type of functions should always be declared. If function
prototypes are available, use them. One common mistake is to omit the
declaration of external math functions that return <span class=
"emphasis"><em>double</em></span>. The compiler then assumes that the return
value is an integer and the bits are dutifully converted into a (meaningless)
floating point value.</p>

<p>"<span class="emphasis"><em>C takes the point of view that the programmer is
always right.</em></span>" -- Michael DeCorte"</p>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h3 class="title"><a name="N10203" id="N10203"></a> Function Declarations</h3>
</div>

<p>Each function should be preceded by a block comment prologue that gives a
short description of what the function does and (if not clear) how to use it.
Discussion of non-trivial design decisions and side-effects is also
appropriate. Avoid duplicating information clear from the code.</p>

<p>The function return type should be alone on a line, (optionally) indented
one stop4.</p>

<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>"Tabstops" can be blanks (spaces) inserted by your editor in clumps of 2, 4,
or 8. Use actual tabs where possible. Do not default to <span class=

should be given return type <span class="emphasis"><em>void</em></span>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><code class="literal">#define</code> <code class="literal">void</code> or
<code class="literal">#define</code> <code class="literal">void</code>
<code class="literal">int</code> for compilers without the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>void</em></span> keyword. If the value returned requires a long
explanation, it should be given in the prologue; otherwise it can be on the
same line as the return type, tabbed over. The function name (and the formal
parameter list) should be alone on a line, in column 1. Destination (return
value) parameters should generally be first (on the left). All formal parameter
declarations, local declarations and code within the function body should be
tabbed over one stop. The opening brace of the function body should be alone on
a line beginning in column 1.</p>

<p>Each parameter should be declared (do not default to <span class=
"emphasis"><em>int</em></span>). In general the role of each variable in the
function should be described. This may either be done in the function comment
or, if each declaration is on its own line, in a comment on that line. Loop
counters called "i", string pointers called "s", and integral types called "c"
and used for characters are typically excluded. If a group of functions all
have a like parameter or local variable, it helps to call the repeated variable
by the same name in all functions. (Conversely, avoid using the same name for
different purposes in related functions.) Like parameters should also appear in
the same place in the various argument lists.</p>

<p>Comments for parameters and local variables should be tabbed so that they
line up underneath each other. Local variable declarations should be separated
from the function's statements by a blank line.</p>

<p>Be careful when you use or declare functions that take a variable number of
arguments ("varargs"). There is no truly portable way to do varargs in C.
Better to design an interface that uses a fixed number of arguments. If you
must have varargs, use the library macros for declaring functions with variant
argument lists.</p>

<p>If the function uses any external variables (or functions) that are not
declared globally in the file, these should have their own declarations in the
function body using the <span class="emphasis"><em>extern</em></span>
keyword.</p>

<p>Avoid local declarations that override declarations at higher levels. In
particular, local variables should not be redeclared in nested blocks. Although
this is valid C, the potential confusion is enough that <span class=
"emphasis"><em>lint</em></span> will complain about it when given the -h
option.</p>

C considers to be false. An explicit test will help you out later when somebody
decides that a failure return should be -1 instead of 0. Explicit comparison
should be used even if the comparison value will never change; e.g.,
"<code class="literal">if (!(bufsize % sizeof(int)))</code>" should be written
instead as "<code class="literal">if ((bufsize % sizeof(int)) == 0)</code>" to
reflect the <span class="emphasis"><em>numeric</em></span> (not <span class=
"emphasis"><em>boolean</em></span>) nature of the test. A frequent trouble spot
is using <code class="literal">strcmp</code> to test for string equality, where
the result should <span class="emphasis"><em>never</em></span> <span class=
"emphasis"><em>ever</em></span> be defaulted. The preferred approach is to
define a macro <span class="emphasis"><em>STREQ</em></span>.
<pre class="programlisting">

<p>The non-zero test <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> often defaulted

Call a predicate <span class="emphasis"><em>isvalid</em></span> or <span class=
"emphasis"><em>valid</em></span>, not <span class=
"emphasis"><em>checkvalid</em></span>.</p>

<p>It is common practice to declare a boolean type "<code class=
"literal">bool</code>" in a global include file. The special names improve
readability immensely.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   typedef int bool;
   #define FALSE 0
   #define TRUE 1
</pre>or
<pre class="programlisting">
   typedef enum { NO=0, YES } bool;
</pre>Even with these declarations, do not check a boolean value for equality
with 1 (TRUE, YES, etc.); instead test for inequality with 0 (FALSE, NO, etc.).
Most functions are guaranteed to return 0 if false, but only non-zero if true.
Thus,
<pre class="programlisting">
   if (func() == TRUE) { ...
</pre>must be written
<pre class="programlisting">
   if (func() != FALSE) { ...
</pre>It is even better (where possible) to rename the function/variable or
rewrite the expression so that the meaning is obvious without a comparison to
true or false (e.g., rename to <span class=
"emphasis"><em>isvalid()</em></span>).
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>There is a time and a place for embedded assignment statements. In some
constructs there is no better way to accomplish the results without making the
code bulkier and less readable.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
    process the character
   }
</pre>The <code class="literal">++</code> and <code class="literal">--</code>
operators count as assignment statements. So, for many purposes, do functions
with side effects. Using embedded assignment statements to improve run-time
performance is also possible. However, one should consider the tradeoff between
increased speed and decreased maintainability that results when embedded
assignments are used in artificial places. For example,
<pre class="programlisting">
   a = b + c;
   d = a + r;
</pre>should not be replaced by
<pre class="programlisting">
   d = (a = b + c) + r;
</pre>even though the latter may save one cycle. In the long run the time
difference between the two will decrease as the optimizer gains maturity, while
the difference in ease of maintenance will increase as the human memory of
what's going on in the latter piece of code begins to fade.

<p>Goto statements should be used sparingly, as in any well-structured code.
The main place where they can be usefully employed is to break out of several
levels of <span class="emphasis"><em>switch</em></span>, <span class=
"emphasis"><em>for</em></span>, and <span class=
"emphasis"><em>while</em></span> nesting, although the need to do such a thing
may indicate that the inner constructs should be broken out into a separate
function, with a success/failure return code.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
    for (...) {
     while (...) {
      ...
      if (disaster)
       goto error;
    
     }
    }
    ...
   error:
    clean up the mess
</pre>When a <span class="emphasis"><em>goto</em></span> is necessary the
accompanying label should be alone on a line and tabbed one stop to the left of
the code that follows. The goto should be commented (possibly in the block
header) as to its utility and purpose. <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Continue</em></span> should be used sparingly and near the top
of the loop. <span class="emphasis"><em>Break</em></span> is less troublesome.

<p>parameters to non-prototyped functions sometimes need to be promoted
explicitly. If, for example, a function expects a 32-bit <span class=
"emphasis"><em>long</em></span> and gets handed a 16-bit <span class=
"emphasis"><em>int</em></span> instead, the stack can get misaligned. Problems
occur with pointer, integral, and floating-point values.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h2 class="title c3"><a name="N10325" id="N10325"></a>Compound Statements</h2>
</div>

<p>A compound statement is a list of statements enclosed by braces. There are
many common ways of formatting the braces. Be consistent with your local
standard, if you have one, or pick one and use it consistently. When editing
someone else's code, <span class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> use the
style used in that code.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   control {
           statement;
           statement;
   }
</pre>

<p>The style above is called "K&amp;R style", and is preferred if you haven't
already got a favorite. With K&amp;R style, the <code class=
"literal">else</code> part of an <span class="emphasis"><em>if-else</em></span>
statement and the <code class="literal">while</code> part of a <span class=
"emphasis"><em>do-while</em></span> statement should appear on the same line as
the close brace. With most other styles, the braces are always alone on a
line.</p>

<p>When a block of code has several labels (unless there are a lot of them),
the labels are placed on separate lines. The fall-through feature of the C
<span class="emphasis"><em>switch</em></span> statement, (that is, when there
is no <code class="literal">break</code> between a code segment and the next
<code class="literal">case</code> statement) must be commented for future
maintenance. A lint-style comment/directive is best.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   switch (expr) {
   case ABC:
   case DEF:
    statement;
    break;
   case UVW:
    statement;
    /*FALLTHROUGH*/
   case XYZ:
    statement;
    break;
   }
</pre>

<p>Here, the last <code class="literal">break</code> is unnecessary, but is
required because it prevents a fall-through error if another <code class=
"literal">case</code> is added later after the last one. The <code class=
"literal">default</code> case, if used, should be last and does not require a
<code class="literal">break</code> if it is last.</p>

<p>Whenever an <span class="emphasis"><em>if-else</em></span> statement has a
compound statement for either the <span class="emphasis"><em>if</em></span> or
<span class="emphasis"><em>else</em></span> section, the statements of both the
<span class="emphasis"><em>if</em></span> and <span class=
"emphasis"><em>else</em></span> sections should both be enclosed in braces
(called <span class="emphasis"><em>fully bracketed syntax</em></span>).</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   if (expr) {
    statement;
   } else {
    statement;
    statement;
   }
</pre>Braces are also essential in <span class=
"emphasis"><em>if-if-else</em></span> sequences with no second <span class=
"emphasis"><em>else</em></span> such as the following, which will be parsed
incorrectly if the brace after <code class="literal">(ex1)</code> and its mate
are omitted:
<pre class="programlisting">
   if (ex1) {
    if (ex2) {
     funca();
    }
   } else {
    funcb();
   }
</pre>

<p>An <span class="emphasis"><em>if-else</em></span> with <span class=
"emphasis"><em>else if</em></span> should be written with the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>else</em></span> conditions left-justified.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   if (STREQ (reply, "yes")) {
    statements for yes
    ...
   } else if (STREQ (reply, "no")) {
    ...
   } else if (STREQ (reply, "maybe")) {
    ...
   } else {
    statements for default
    ...
   }
</pre>The format then looks like a generalized <span class=
"emphasis"><em>switch</em></span> statement and the tabbing reflects the switch
between exactly one of several alternatives rather than a nesting of
statements.

<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Do-while</em></span> loops should always have
braces around the body.</p>

<p>The following code is very dangerous:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   #ifdef CIRCUIT
   # define CLOSE_CIRCUIT(circno) { close_circ(circno); }
   #else
   # define CLOSE_CIRCUIT(circno)
   #endif
    ...
    if (expr)
     statement;
    else
     CLOSE_CIRCUIT(x)
    ++i;
</pre>Note that on systems where CIRCUIT is not defined the statement
"<code class="literal">++i;</code>" will only get executed when <code class=
"literal">expr</code> is false! This example points out both the value of
naming macros with CAPS and of making code fully-bracketed.

<p>Sometimes an <span class="emphasis"><em>if</em></span> causes an
unconditional control transfer via <code class="literal">break</code>,
<code class="literal">continue</code>, <code class="literal">goto</code>, or
<code class="literal">return</code>. The <span class=
"emphasis"><em>else</em></span> should be implicit and the code should not be
indented.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   if (level&gt; limit)
    return (OVERFLOW)
   normal();
   return (level);
</pre>The "flattened" indentation tells the reader that the boolean test is
invariant over the rest of the enclosing block.

<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h2 class="title c3"><a name="N103D8" id="N103D8"></a>Operators</h2>
</div>

<p>Unary operators should not be separated from their single operand.
Generally, all binary operators except '<code class="literal">.</code>' and
'<code class="literal">-&gt;</code>' should be separated from their operands by
blanks. Some judgement is called for in the case of complex expressions, which
may be clearer if the "inner" operators are not surrounded by spaces and the
"outer" ones are.</p>

<p>If you think an expression will be hard to read, consider breaking it across
lines. Splitting at the lowest-precedence operator near the break is best.
Since C has some unexpected precedence rules, expressions involving mixed
operators should be parenthesized. Too many parentheses, however, can make a
line <span class="emphasis"><em>harder</em></span> to read because humans
aren't good at parenthesis-matching.</p>

<p>There is a time and place for the binary comma operator, but generally it
should be avoided. The comma operator is most useful to provide multiple
initializations or operations, as in <span class="emphasis"><em>for</em></span>
statements. Complex expressions, for instance those with nested ternary
<span class="emphasis"><em>?:</em></span> operators, can be confusing and
should be avoided if possible. There are some macros like <code class=
"literal">getchar</code> where both the ternary operator and comma operators
are useful. The logical expression operand before the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>?:</em></span> should be parenthesized and both return values
must be the same type.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h2 class="title c3"><a name="N103FD" id="N103FD"></a>Naming Conventions</h2>
</div>

<p>Individual projects will no doubt have their own naming conventions. There
are some general rules however.</p>

<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Names with leading and trailing underscores are reserved for system purposes
and should not be used for any user-created names. Most systems use them for
names that the user should not have to know. If you must have your own private
identifiers, begin them with a letter or two identifying the package to which
they belong.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>#define constants should be in all CAPS.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Enum constants are Capitalized or in all CAPS</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Function, typedef, and variable names, as well as struct, union, and enum
tag names should be in lower case.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Many macro "functions" are in all CAPS. Some macros (such as <code class=
"literal">getchar</code> and <code class="literal">putchar</code>) are in lower
case since they may also exist as functions. Lower-case macro names are only
acceptable if the macros behave like a function call, that is, they evaluate
their parameters <span class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span> once and do not
assign values to named parameters. Sometimes it is impossible to write a macro
that behaves like a function even though the arguments are evaluated exactly
once.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Avoid names that differ only in case, like <span class=
"emphasis"><em>foo</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Foo</em></span>.
Similarly, avoid <span class="emphasis"><em>foobar</em></span> and <span class=
"emphasis"><em>foo_bar</em></span>. The potential for confusion is
considerable.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Similarly, avoid names that look like each other. On many terminals and
printers, 'l', '1' and 'I' look quite similar. A variable named 'l' is
particularly bad because it looks so much like the constant '1'.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>In general, global names (including <span class=
"emphasis"><em>enum</em></span>s) should have a common prefix identifying the
module that they belong with. Globals may alternatively be grouped in a global
structure. Typedeffed names often have "<code class="literal">_t</code>"
appended to their name.</p>

<p>Avoid names that might conflict with various standard library names. Some
systems will include more library code than you want. Also, your program may be
extended someday.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h2 class="title c3"><a name="N10441" id="N10441"></a>Constants</h2>
</div>

<p>Numerical constants should not be coded directly. The <span class=
"emphasis"><em>#define</em></span> feature of the C preprocessor should be used
to give constants meaningful names. Symbolic constants make the code easier to
read. Defining the value in one place also makes it easier to administer large
programs since the constant value can be changed uniformly by changing only the
define. The enumeration data type is a better way to declare variables that
take on only a discrete set of values, since additional type checking is often
available. At the very least, any directly-coded numerical constant must have a
comment explaining the derivation of the value.</p>

<p>Constants should be defined consistently with their use; e.g. use
<code class="literal">540.0</code> for a float instead of <code class=
"literal">540</code> with an implicit float cast. There are some cases where
the constants 0 and 1 may appear as themselves instead of as defines. For
example if a <span class="emphasis"><em>for</em></span> loop indexes through an
array, then</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   for (i = 0; i &lt; ARYBOUND; i++)
</pre>is reasonable while the code
<pre class="programlisting">
   door_t *front_door = opens(door[i], 7);
   if (front_door == 0)
    error("can't open %s\\n", door[i]);
</pre>is not. In the last example <code class="literal">front_door</code> is a
pointer. When a value is a pointer it should be compared to <code class=
"literal">NULL</code> instead of 0. <span class="emphasis"><em>NULL</em></span>
is available either as part of the standard I/O library's header file
<span class="emphasis"><em>stdio.h</em></span> or in <span class=
"emphasis"><em>stdlib.h</em></span> for newer systems. Even simple values like
1 or 0 are often better expressed using defines like <span class=
"emphasis"><em>TRUE</em></span> and <span class=
"emphasis"><em>FALSE</em></span> (sometimes <span class=
"emphasis"><em>YES</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>NO</em></span>
read better).

<p>Simple character constants should be defined as character literals rather
than numbers. Non-text characters are discouraged as non-portable. If non-text
characters are necessary, particularly if they are used in strings, they should
be written using a escape character of three octal digits rather than one
(e.g., <code class="literal">'\007'</code>). Even so, such usage should be
considered machine-dependent and treated as such.</p>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h3 class="title"><a name="N10488" id="N10488"></a> Macros</h3>
</div>

<p>Complex expressions can be used as macro parameters, and operator-precedence
problems can arise unless all occurrences of parameters have parentheses around
them. There is little that can be done about the problems caused by side
effects in parameters except to avoid side effects in expressions (a good idea
anyway) and, when possible, to write macros that evaluate their parameters
exactly once. There are times when it is impossible to write macros that act
exactly like functions.</p>

<p>Some macros also exist as functions (e.g., <code class="literal">getc</code>
and <code class="literal">fgetc</code>). The macro should be used in
implementing the function so that changes to the macro will be automatically
reflected in the function. Care is needed when interchanging macros and
functions since function parameters are passed by value, while macro parameters
are passed by name substitution. Carefree use of macros requires that they be
declared carefully.</p>

<p>Macros should avoid using globals, since the global name may be hidden by a
local declaration. Macros that change named parameters (rather than the storage
they point at) or may be used as the left-hand side of an assignment should
mention this in their comments. Macros that take no parameters but reference
variables, are long, or are aliases for function calls should be given an empty
parameter list, e.g.,</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   #define OFF_A() (a_global+OFFSET)
   #define BORK() (zork())
   #define SP3() if (b) { int x; av = f (&amp;x); bv += x; }
</pre>

<p>Macros save function call/return overhead, but when a macro gets long, the
effect of the call/return becomes negligible, so a function should be used
instead.</p>

<p>In some cases it is appropriate to make the compiler insure that a macro is
terminated with a semicolon.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   if (x==3)
       SP3();
   else
       BORK();
</pre>If the semicolon is omitted after the call to <code class=
"literal">SP3</code>, then the <code class="literal">else</code> will
(silently!) become associated with the <code class="literal">if</code> in the
<code class="literal">SP3</code> macro. With the semicolon, the <code class=
"literal">else</code> doesn't match <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span>
<code class="literal">if</code>! The macro <code class="literal">SP3</code> can
be written safely as
<pre class="programlisting">
   #define SP3() \\
    do { if (b) { int x; av = f (&amp;x); bv += x; }} while (0)
</pre>Writing out the enclosing <span class="emphasis"><em>do-while</em></span>
by hand is awkward and some compilers and tools may complain that there is a
constant in the "<code class="literal">while</code>" conditional. A macro for
declaring statements may make programming easier.
<pre class="programlisting">
   #ifdef lint
    static int ZERO;
   #else
   # define ZERO 0
   #endif
   #define STMT( stuff )  do { stuff } while (ZERO)
</pre>Declare <code class="literal">SP3</code> with
<pre class="programlisting">
   #define SP3() \\
    STMT( if (b) { int x; av = f (&amp;x); bv += x; } )
</pre>Using <code class="literal">STMT</code> will help prevent small typos
from silently changing programs. Except for type casts, <code class=
"literal">sizeof</code>, and hacks such as the above, macros should contain
keywords only if the entire macro is surrounded by braces.

Compilation.</h3>
</div>

<p>Conditional compilation is useful for things like machine-dependencies,
debugging, and for setting certain options at compile-time. Beware of
conditional compilation. Various controls can easily combine in unforeseen
ways. If you #ifdef machine dependencies, make sure that when no machine is
specified, the result is an error, not a default machine. (Use "<code class=
"literal">#error</code>" and indent it so it works with older compilers.) If
you #ifdef optimizations, the default should be the unoptimized code rather
than an uncompilable program. Be sure to test the unoptimized code.</p>

<p>Note that the text inside of an #ifdeffed section may be scanned (processed)
by the compiler, even if the #ifdef is false. Thus, even if the #ifdeffed part
of the file never gets compiled (e.g., <code class="literal">#ifdef
COMMENT</code>), it cannot be arbitrary text.</p>

<p>Put #ifdefs in header files instead of source files when possible. Use the
#ifdefs to define macros that can be used uniformly in the code. For instance,
a header file for checking memory allocation might look like (omitting
definitions for <code class="literal">REALLOC</code> and <code class=
"literal">FREE</code>):</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   #ifdef DEBUG
    extern void *mm_malloc();
   # define MALLOC(size) (mm_malloc(size))
   #else
    extern void *malloc();
   # define MALLOC(size) (malloc(size))
   #endif
</pre>

<p>Conditional compilation should generally be on a feature-by-feature basis.
Machine or operating system dependencies should be avoided in most cases.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   #ifdef BSD4
    long t = time ((long *)NULL);
   #endif
</pre>The preceding code is poor for two reasons: there may be 4BSD systems for
which there is a better choice, and there may be non-4BSD systems for which the
above <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> the best code. Instead, use
<span class="emphasis"><em>define</em></span> symbols such as <code class=
"literal">TIME_LONG</code> and <code class="literal">TIME_STRUCT</code> and
define the appropriate one in a configuration file such as <span class=
"emphasis"><em>config.h</em></span>.

<h3 class="title"><a name="N10515" id="N10515"></a>Debugging</h3>
</div>

<p>"<span class="emphasis"><em>C Code. C code run. Run, code, run...
PLEASE!!!</em></span>" -- Barbara Tongue</p>

<p>If you use <span class="emphasis"><em>enum</em></span>s, the first enum
constant should have a non-zero value, or the first constant should indicate an
error.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   enum { STATE_ERR, STATE_START, STATE_NORMAL, STATE_END } state_t;
   enum { VAL_NEW=1, VAL_NORMAL, VAL_DYING, VAL_DEAD } value_t;
</pre>Uninitialized values will then often "catch themselves".

<p>Check for error return values, even from functions that "can't" fail.
Consider that <code class="literal">close()</code> and <code class=
"literal">fclose()</code> can and do fail, even when all prior file operations
have succeeded. Write your own functions so that they test for errors and
return error values or abort the program in a well-defined way. Include a lot
of debugging and error-checking code and leave most of it in the finished
product. Check even for "impossible" errors. [8]</p>

<p>Use the <span class="emphasis"><em>assert</em></span> facility to insist
that each function is being passed well-defined values, and that intermediate
results are well-formed.</p>

<p>Build in the debug code using as few #ifdefs as possible. For instance, if
"<code class="literal">mm_malloc</code>" is a debugging memory allocator, then
<code class="literal">MALLOC</code> will select the appropriate allocator,
avoids littering the code with #ifdefs, and makes clear the difference between
allocation calls being debugged and extra memory that is allocated only during
debugging.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   #ifdef DEBUG
   # define MALLOC(size)  (mm_malloc(size))
   #else
   # define MALLOC(size)  (malloc(size))
   #endif
</pre>

<p>Check bounds even on things that "can't" overflow. A function that writes on
to variable-sized storage should take an argument <code class=
"literal">maxsize</code> that is the size of the destination. If there are
times when the size of the destination is unknown, some 'magic' value of
<code class="literal">maxsize</code> should mean "no bounds checks". When bound
checks fail, make sure that the function does something useful such as abort or
return an error status.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   /*
    * INPUT: A null-terminated source string 'src' to copy from and
    * a 'dest' string to copy to.  'maxsize' is the size of 'dest'
    * or UINT_MAX if the size is not known.  'src' and 'dest' must
    * both be shorter than UINT_MAX, and 'src' must be no longer than
    * 'dest'.
    * OUTPUT: The address of 'dest' or NULL if the copy fails.
    * 'dest' is modified even when the copy fails.
    */
    char *
   copy (dest, maxsize, src)
    char *dest, *src;
    unsigned maxsize;
   {
    char *dp = dest;
    while (maxsize--&gt; 0)
     if ((*dp++ = *src++) == '\\0')
      return (dest);
    return (NULL);
   }
</pre>

<p>In all, remember that a program that produces wrong answers twice as fast is
infinitely slower. The same is true of programs that crash occasionally or
clobber valid data.</p>

<h3 class="title"><a name="N10553" id="N10553"></a>Portability</h3>
</div>

<p>"<span class="emphasis"><em>C combines the power of assembler with the
portability of assembler.</em></span>" -- Anonymous, alluding to Bill
Thacker.</p>

<p>The advantages of portable code are well known. This section gives some
guidelines for writing portable code. Here, "portable" means that a source file
can be compiled and executed on different machines with the only change being
the inclusion of possibly different header files and the use of different
compiler flags. The header files will contain #defines and typedefs that may
vary from machine to machine. In general, a new "machine" is different
hardware, a different operating system, a different compiler, or any
combination of these. Reference [1] contains useful information on both style
and portability. The following is a list of pitfalls to be avoided and
recommendations to be considered when designing portable code:</p>

<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Write portable code first, worry about detail optimizations only on machines
where they prove necessary. Optimized code is often obscure. Optimizations for
one machine may produce worse code on another. Document performance hacks and
localize them as much as possible. Documentation should explain <span class=
"emphasis"><em>how</em></span> it works and <span class=
"emphasis"><em>why</em></span> it was needed (e.g., "loop executes 6 zillion
times").</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Recognize that some things are inherently non-portable. Examples are code to
deal with particular hardware registers such as the program status word, and
code that is designed to support a particular piece of hardware, such as an
assembler or I/O driver. Even in these cases there are many routines and data
organizations that can be made machine independent.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Organize source files so that the machine-independent code and the
machine-dependent code are in separate files. Then if the program is to be
moved to a new machine, it is a much easier task to determine what needs to be
changed. Comment the machine dependence in the headers of the appropriate
files.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Any behavior that is described as "implementation defined" should be treated
as a machine (compiler) dependency. Assume that the compiler or hardware does
it some completely screwy way.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Pay attention to word sizes. Objects may be non-intuitive sizes, Pointers
are not always the same size as <span class="emphasis"><em>int</em></span>s,
the same size as each other, or freely interconvertible. The following table
shows bit sizes for basic types in C for various machines and compilers.</p>

<li>
<p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>void*</em></span> type is guaranteed to have
enough bits of precision to hold a pointer to any data object. The <span class=
"emphasis"><em>void(*)()</em></span> type is guaranteed to be able to hold a
pointer to any function. Use these types when you need a generic pointer. (Use
<span class="emphasis"><em>char*</em></span> and <span class=
"emphasis"><em>char(*)()</em></span>, respectively, in older compilers). Be
sure to cast pointers back to the correct type before using them.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Even when, say, an <span class="emphasis"><em>int*</em></span> and a
<span class="emphasis"><em>char*</em></span> are the same <span class=
"emphasis"><em>size</em></span>, they may have different <span class=
"emphasis"><em>formats</em></span>. For example, the following will fail on
some machines that have <code class="literal">sizeof(int*)</code> equal to
<code class="literal">sizeof(char*)</code>. The code fails because <code class=
"literal">free</code> expects a <span class="emphasis"><em>char*</em></span>
and gets passed an <span class="emphasis"><em>int*</em></span>.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   int *p = (int *) malloc (sizeof(int));
   free (p);
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Note that the <span class="emphasis"><em>size</em></span> of an object does
not guarantee the <span class="emphasis"><em>precision</em></span> of that
object. The Cray-2 may use 64 bits to store an <span class=
"emphasis"><em>int</em></span>, but a <span class=
"emphasis"><em>long</em></span> cast into an <span class=
"emphasis"><em>int</em></span> and back to a <span class=
"emphasis"><em>long</em></span> may be truncated to 32 bits.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The integer <span class="emphasis"><em>constant</em></span> zero may be cast
to any pointer type. The resulting pointer is called a <span class=
"emphasis"><em>null pointer</em></span> for that type, and is different from
any other pointer of that type. A null pointer always compares equal to the
constant zero. A null pointer might <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
compare equal with a variable that has the value zero. Null pointers are
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> always stored with all bits zero.
Null pointers for two different types are sometimes different. A null pointer
of one type cast in to a pointer of another type will be cast in to the null
pointer for that second type.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>On ANSI compilers, when two pointers of the same type access the same
storage, they will compare as equal. When non-zero integer constants are cast
to pointer types, they may become identical to other pointers. On non-ANSI
compilers, pointers that access the same storage may compare as different. The
following two pointers, for instance, may or may not compare equal, and they
may or may not access the same storage6.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The code may also fail to compile, fault on pointer creation, fault on
pointer comparison, or fault on pointer dereferences.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   ((int *) 2 )
   ((int *) 3 )
</pre>If you need 'magic' pointers other than NULL, either allocate some
storage or treat the pointer as a machine dependence.
<pre class="programlisting">
   
extern int x_int_dummy;  /* in x.c */
   #define X_FAIL (NULL)
   #define X_BUSY (&amp;x_int_dummy)
</pre>
<pre class="programlisting">
   #define X_FAIL (NULL)
   #define X_BUSY MD_PTR1  /* MD_PTR1 from "machdep.h" */
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Floating-point numbers have both a <span class=
"emphasis"><em>precision</em></span> and a <span class=
"emphasis"><em>range</em></span>. These are independent of the size of the
object. Thus, overflow (underflow) for a 32-bit floating-point number will
happen at different values on different machines. Also, 4.9 times 5.1 will
yield two different numbers on two different machines. Differences in rounding
and truncation can give surprisingly different answers.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>On some machines, a <span class="emphasis"><em>double</em></span> may have
<span class="emphasis"><em>less</em></span> range or precision than a
<span class="emphasis"><em>float</em></span>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>On some machines the first half of a <span class=
"emphasis"><em>double</em></span> may be a <span class=
"emphasis"><em>float</em></span> with similar value. Do <span class=
"emphasis"><em>not</em></span> depend on this.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Watch out for signed characters. On some VAXes, for instance, characters are
sign extended when used in expressions, which is not the case on many other
machines. Code that assumes signed/unsigned is unportable. For example,
<code class="literal">array[c]</code> won't work if <code class=
"literal">c</code> is supposed to be positive and is instead signed and
negative. If you must assume signed or unsigned characters, comment them as
<code class="literal">SIGNED</code> or <code class="literal">UNSIGNED</code>.
Unsigned behavior can be guaranteed with <code class="literal">unsigned
char</code>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Avoid assuming ASCII. If you must assume, document and localize. Remember
that characters may hold (much) more than 8 bits.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Code that takes advantage of the two's complement representation of numbers
on most machines should not be used. Optimizations that replace arithmetic
operations with equivalent shifting operations are particularly suspect. If
absolutely necessary, machine-dependent code should be #ifdeffed or operations
should be performed by #ifdeffed macros. You should weigh the time savings with
the potential for obscure and difficult bugs when your code is moved.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In general, if the word size or value range is important, typedef "sized"
types. Large programs should have a central header file which supplies typedefs
for commonly-used width-sensitive types, to make it easier to change them and
to aid in finding width-sensitive code. Unsigned types other than <span class=
"emphasis"><em>unsigned int</em></span> are highly compiler-dependent. If a
simple loop counter is being used where either 16 or 32 bits will do, then use
<span class="emphasis"><em>int</em></span>, since it will get the most
efficient (natural) unit for the current machine.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Data <span class="emphasis"><em>alignment</em></span> is also important. For
instance, on various machines a 4-byte integer may start at any address, start
only at an even address, or start only at a multiple-of-four address. Thus, a
particular structure may have its elements at different offsets on different
machines, even when given elements are the same size on all machines. Indeed, a
structure of a 32-bit pointer and an 8-bit character may be 3 sizes on 3
different machines. As a corollary, pointers to objects may not be interchanged
freely; saving an integer through a pointer to 4 bytes starting at an odd
address will sometimes work, sometimes cause a core dump, and sometimes fail
silently (clobbering other data in the process). Pointer-to-character is a
particular trouble spot on machines which do not address to the byte. Alignment
considerations and loader peculiarities make it very rash to assume that two
consecutively-declared variables are together in memory, or that a variable of
one type is aligned appropriately to be used as another type.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The bytes of a word are of increasing significance with increasing address
on machines such as the VAX (little-endian) and of decreasing significance with
increasing address on other machines such as the 68000 (big-endian). The order
of bytes in a word and of words in larger objects (say, a double word) might
not be the same. Hence any code that depends on the left-right orientation of
bits in an object deserves special scrutiny. Bit fields within structure
members will only be portable so long as two separate fields are never
concatenated and treated as a unit. [1,3] Actually, it is nonportable to
concatenate <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> two variables.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>There may be unused holes in structures. Suspect unions used for type
cheating. Specifically, a value should not be stored as one type and retrieved
as another. An explicit tag field for unions may be useful.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Different compilers use different conventions for returning structures. This
causes a problem when libraries return structure values to code compiled with a
different compiler. Structure pointers are not a problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Do not make assumptions about the parameter passing mechanism. especially
pointer sizes and parameter evaluation order, size, etc. The following code,
for instance, is <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> nonportable.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
    c = foo (getchar(), getchar());
    char
   foo (c1, c2, c3)
    char c1, c2, c3;
   {
    char bar = *(&amp;c1 + 1);
    return (bar);   /* often won't return c2 */
   }
</pre>This example has lots of problems. The stack may grow up or down (indeed,
there need not even be a stack!). parameters may be widened when they are
passed, so a <span class="emphasis"><em>char</em></span> might be passed as an
<span class="emphasis"><em>int</em></span>, for instance. Arguments may be
pushed left-to-right, right-to-left, in arbitrary order, or passed in registers
(not pushed at all). The order of evaluation may differ from the order in which
they are pushed. One compiler may use several (incompatible) calling
conventions.
</li>

<li>
<p>On some machines, the null character pointer <code class="literal">((char
*)0)</code> is treated the same way as a pointer to a null string. Do
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> depend on this.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Do not modify string constants7.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Some libraries attempt to modify and then restore read-only string
variables. Programs sometimes won't port because of these broken libraries. The
libraries are getting better. One particularly notorious (bad) example is</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   s = "/dev/tty??";
   strcpy (&amp;s[8], ttychars);
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>The address space may have holes. Simply <span class=
"emphasis"><em>computing</em></span> the address of an unallocated element in
an array (before or after the actual storage of the array) may crash the
program. If the address is used in a comparison, sometimes the program will run
but clobber data, give wrong answers, or loop forever. In ANSI C, a pointer
into an array of objects may legally point to the first element after the end
of the array; this is usually safe in older implementations. This "outside"
pointer may not be dereferenced.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Only the <code class="literal">==</code> and <code class="literal">!=</code>
comparisons are defined for all pointers of a given type. It is only portable
to use <code class="literal">&lt;</code>, <code class="literal">&lt;=</code>,
<code class="literal">&gt;</code>, or <code class="literal">&gt;=</code> to
compare pointers when they both point in to (or to the first element after) the
same array. It is likewise only portable to use arithmetic operators on
pointers that both point into the same array or the first element
afterwards.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Word size also affects shifts and masks. The following code will clear only
the three rightmost bits of an <span class="emphasis"><em>int</em></span> on
<span class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> 68000s. On other machines it will
also clear the upper two bytes.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   x &amp;= 0177770
</pre>Use instead
<pre class="programlisting">
   x &amp;= ~07
</pre>which works properly on all machines. Bitfields do not have these
problems.
</li>

<li>
<p>Side effects within expressions can result in code whose semantics are
compiler-dependent, since C's order of evaluation is explicitly undefined in
most places. Notorious examples include the following.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   a[i] = b[i++];
</pre>In the above example, we know only that the subscript into <code class=
"literal">b</code> has not been incremented. The index into <code class=
"literal">a</code> could be the value of <code class="literal">i</code> either
before or after the increment.
<pre class="programlisting">
   struct bar_t { struct bar_t *next; } bar;
   bar-&gt;next = bar = tmp;
</pre>In the second example, the address of "<code class=
"literal">bar-&gt;next</code>" may be computed before the value is assigned to
"<code class="literal">bar</code>".
<pre class="programlisting">
   bar = bar-&gt;next = tmp;
</pre>In the third example, <code class="literal">bar</code> can be assigned
before <code class="literal">bar-&gt;next.</code> Although this <span class=
"emphasis"><em>appears</em></span> to violate the rule that "assignment
proceeds right-to-left", it is a legal interpretation. Consider the following
example:
<pre class="programlisting">
   long i;
   short a[N];
   i = old
   i = a[i] = new;
</pre>The value that "<code class="literal">i</code>" is assigned must be a
value that is typed as if assignment proceeded right-to-left. However,
"<code class="literal">i</code>" may be assigned the value "<code class=
"literal">(long)(short)new</code>" before "<code class="literal">a[i]</code>"
is assigned to. Compilers do differ.
</li>

<li>
<p>Be suspicious of numeric values appearing in the code ("magic numbers").</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Avoid preprocessor tricks. Tricks such as using <code class=
"literal">/**/</code> for token pasting and macros that rely on argument string
expansion will break reliably.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   #define FOO(string) (printf("string = %s",(string)))
   ...
   FOO(filename);
</pre>Will only sometimes be expanded to
<pre class="programlisting">
   (printf("filename = %s",(filename)))
</pre>Be aware, however, that tricky preprocessors may cause macros to break
<span class="emphasis"><em>accidentally</em></span> on some machines. Consider
the following two versions of a macro.
<pre class="programlisting">
   #define LOOKUP(chr) (a['c'+(chr)]) /* Works as intended. */
   #define LOOKUP(c) (a['c'+(c)])  /* Sometimes breaks. */
</pre>The second version of <code class="literal">LOOKUP</code> can be expanded
in two different ways and will cause code to break mysteriously.
</li>

<li>
<p>Become familiar with existing library functions and defines. (But not
<span class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> familiar. The internal details of
library facilities, as opposed to their external interfaces, are subject to
change without warning. They are also often quite unportable.) You should not
be writing your own string compare routine, terminal control routines, or
making your own defines for system structures. "Rolling your own" wastes your
time and makes your code less readable, because another reader has to figure
out whether you're doing something special in that reimplemented stuff to
justify its existence. It also prevents your program from taking advantage of
any microcode assists or other means of improving performance of system
routines. Furthermore, it's a fruitful source of bugs. If possible, be aware of
the <span class="emphasis"><em>differences</em></span> between the common
libraries (such as ANSI, POSIX, and so on).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Use <span class="emphasis"><em>lint</em></span> when it is available. It is
a valuable tool for finding machine-dependent constructs as well as other
inconsistencies or program bugs that pass the compiler. If your compiler has
switches to turn on warnings, use them.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Suspect labels inside blocks with the associated <span class=
"emphasis"><em>switch</em></span> or <span class=
"emphasis"><em>goto</em></span> outside the block.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Wherever the type is in doubt, parameters should be cast to the appropriate
type. Always cast NULL when it appears in non-prototyped function calls. Do not
use function calls as a place to do type cheating. C has confusing promotion
rules, so be careful. For example, if a function expects a 32-bit <span class=
"emphasis"><em>long</em></span> and it is passed a 16-bit <span class=
"emphasis"><em>int</em></span> the stack can get misaligned, the value can get
promoted wrong, etc.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Use explicit casts when doing arithmetic that mixes signed and unsigned
values.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The inter-procedural goto, <span class="emphasis"><em>longjmp</em></span>,
should be used with caution. Many implementations "forget" to restore values in
registers. Declare critical values as <span class=
"emphasis"><em>volatile</em></span> if you can or comment them as <code class=
"literal">VOLATILE</code>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Some linkers convert names to lower-case and some only recognize the first
six letters as unique. Programs may break quietly on these systems.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Beware of compiler extensions. If used, document and consider them as
machine dependencies.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A program cannot generally execute code in the data segment or write into
the code segment. Even when it can, there is no guarantee that it can do so
reliably.</p>

</div>

<p>Modern C compilers support some or all of the ANSI proposed standard C.
Whenever possible, write code to run under standard C, and use features such as
function prototypes, constant storage, and volatile storage. Standard C
improves program performance by giving better information to optimizers.
Standard C improves portability by insuring that all compilers accept the same
input language and by providing mechanisms that try to hide machine
dependencies or emit warnings about code that may be machine-dependent.</p>

<div class="titlepage">
<h3 class="title"><a name="N1084D" id="N1084D"></a>Compatibility</h3>
</div>

<p>Write code that is easy to port to older compilers. For instance,</p>

<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>conditionally #define new (standard) keywords such as <span class=
"emphasis"><em>const</em></span> and <span class=
"emphasis"><em>volatile</em></span> in a global <span class=
"emphasis"><em>.h</em></span> file. Standard compilers pre-define the
preprocessor symbol <code class="literal">__STDC__</code>8.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Some compilers predefine <code class="literal">__STDC__</code> to be 0, in
an attempt to indicate partial compliance with the ANSI C standard.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to determine <span class=
"emphasis"><em>which</em></span> ANSI facilities are provided. Thus, such
compilers are broken. See the rule about "don't write around a broken compiler
unless you are forced to." The <span class="emphasis"><em>void*</em></span>
type is hard to get right simply, since some older compilers understand
<code class="literal">void</code> but not <code class="literal">void*</code>.
It is easiest to create a new (machine- and compiler-dependent) <code class=
"literal">VOIDP</code> type, usually <span class=
"emphasis"><em>char*</em></span> on older compilers.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   #if __STDC__
    typedef void *voidp;
   # define COMPILER_SELECTED
   #endif
   #ifdef A_TARGET
   # define const
   # define volatile
   # define void int
    typedef char *voidp;
   # define COMPILER_SELECTED
   #endif
   #ifdef ...
    ...
   #endif
   #ifdef COMPILER_SELECTED
   # undef COMPILER_SELECTED
   #else
    { NO TARGET SELECTED! }
   #endif
</pre>

<p>Note that under ANSI C, the '#' for a preprocessor directive must be the
first non-whitespace character on a line. Under older compilers it must be the
first character on the line.</p>

<p>When a static function has a forward declaration, the forward declaration
must include the storage class. For older compilers, the class must be
"<span class="emphasis"><em>extern</em></span>". For ANSI compilers, the class
must be "<span class="emphasis"><em>static</em></span>". but global functions
must still be declared as "<span class="emphasis"><em>extern</em></span>".
Thus, forward declarations of static functions should use a #define such as
<code class="literal">FWD_STATIC</code> that is #ifdeffed as appropriate.</p>

<p>An "<code class="literal">#ifdef NAME</code>" should end with either
"<code class="literal">#endif</code>" or "<code class="literal">#endif /* NAME
*/</code>", <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> with "<code class=
"literal">#endif NAME</code>". The comment should not be used on short #ifdefs,
as it is clear from the code.</p>

<p>ANSI <span class="emphasis"><em>trigraphs</em></span> may cause programs
with strings containing "<code class="literal">??</code>" may break
mysteriously.</p>

<p>The style for ANSI C is the same as for regular C, with two notable
exceptions: storage qualifiers and parameter lists.</p>

<p>Because <code class="literal">const</code> and <code class=
"literal">volatile</code> have strange binding rules, each <span class=
"emphasis"><em>const</em></span> or <span class=
"emphasis"><em>volatile</em></span> object should have a separate
declaration.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   int const *s;  /* YES */
   int const *s, *t; /* NO */
</pre>

<p>Prototyped functions merge parameter declaration and definition in to one
list. parameters should be commented in the function comment.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   /*
    * 'bp': boat trying to get in.
    * 'stall': a list of stalls, never NULL.
    * returns stall number, 0 =&gt; no room.

<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h3 class="title"><a name="N108DC" id="N108DC"></a>Prototypes</h3>
</div>

<p>Function prototypes should be used to make code more robust and to make it
run faster. Unfortunately, the prototyped <span class=
"emphasis"><em>declaration</em></span></p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   extern void bork (char c);
</pre>is incompatible with the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>definition</em></span>
<pre class="programlisting">
    void
   bork (c)
    char c;
   ...
</pre>The prototype says that <code class="literal">c</code> is to be passed as
the most natural type for the machine, possibly a byte. The non-prototyped
(backwards-compatible) definition implies that <code class="literal">c</code>
is always passed as an <span class="emphasis"><em>int</em></span>

<p>Such automatic type promotion is called <span class=
"emphasis"><em>widening</em></span>. For older compilers, the widening rules
require that all <span class="emphasis"><em>char</em></span> and <span class=
"emphasis"><em>short</em></span> parameters are passed as <span class=
"emphasis"><em>int</em></span>s and that <span class=
"emphasis"><em>float</em></span> parameters are passed as <span class=
"emphasis"><em>double</em></span>s.</p>

<p>If a function has promotable parameters then the caller and callee must be
compiled identically. Either both must use function prototypes or neither can
use prototypes. The problem can be avoided if parameters are promoted when the
program is designed. For example, <code class="literal">bork</code> can be
defined to take an <span class="emphasis"><em>int</em></span> parameter.</p>

<p>The above declaration works if the definition is prototyped.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
    void
   bork (char c)
   {
    ...
</pre>Unfortunately, the prototyped syntax will cause non-ANSI compilers to
reject the program.

<p>It <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> easy to write external
declarations that work with both prototyping and with older compilers10.</p>

<p>Note that using <code class="literal">PROTO</code> violates the rule "don't
change the syntax via macro substitution." It is regrettable that there isn't a
better solution.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   #if __STDC__
   # define PROTO(x) x
   #else
   # define PROTO(x) ()
   #endif
   extern char **ncopies PROTO((char *s, short times));
     
</pre>

<p>Note that <code class="literal">PROTO</code> must be used with <span class=
"emphasis"><em>double</em></span> parentheses.</p>

<p>In the end, it may be best to write in only one style (e.g., with
prototypes). When a non-prototyped version is needed, it is generated using an
automatic conversion tool.</p>

<h3 class="title"><a name="N10940" id="N10940"></a>Pragmas</h3>
</div>

<p>Pragmas are used to introduce machine-dependent code in a controlled way.
Obviously, pragmas should be treated as machine dependencies. Unfortunately,
the syntax of ANSI pragmas makes it impossible to isolate them in
machine-dependent headers.</p>

<p>Pragmas are of two classes. <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Optimizations</em></span> may safely be ignored. Pragmas that
change the system behavior ("required pragmas") may not. Required pragmas
should be #ifdeffed so that compilation will abort if no pragma is
selected.</p>

<p>Two compilers may use a given pragma in two very different ways. For
instance, one compiler may use "<code class="literal">haggis</code>" to signal
an optimization. Another might use it to indicate that a given statement, if
reached, should terminate the program. Thus, when pragmas are used, they must
always be enclosed in machine-dependent #ifdefs. Pragmas must always be
#ifdefed out for non-ANSI compilers. Be sure to indent the '#' character on the
<code class="literal">#pragma</code>, as older preprocessors will halt on it
otherwise.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   #if defined(__STDC__) &amp;&amp; defined(USE_HAGGIS_PRAGMA)
    #pragma (HAGGIS)
   #endif
</pre>

<p>"<span class="emphasis"><em>The '#pragma' command is specified in the ANSI
standard to have an arbitrary implementation-defined effect. In the GNU C
preprocessor, '#pragma' first attempts to run the game 'rogue'; if that fails,
it tries to run the game 'hack'; if that fails, it tries to run GNU Emacs
displaying the Tower of Hanoi; if that fails, it reports a fatal error. In any
case, preprocessing does not continue.</em></span>" -- Manual for the GNU C

</div>

<div class="orderedlist">
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>This section contains some miscellaneous do's and don'ts.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Don't change syntax via macro substitution. It makes the program
unintelligible to all but the perpetrator.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Don't use floating-point variables where discrete values are needed. Using a
<span class="emphasis"><em>float</em></span> for a loop counter is a great way
to shoot yourself in the foot. Always test floating-point numbers as
<span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;=</em></span> or <span class=
"emphasis"><em>&gt;=</em></span>, never use an exact comparison (<span class=
"emphasis"><em>==</em></span> or <span class=
"emphasis"><em>!=</em></span>).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Compilers have bugs. Common trouble spots include structure assignment and
bitfields. You cannot generally predict which bugs a compiler has. You
<span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> write a program that avoids all
constructs that are known broken on all compilers. You won't be able to write
anything useful, you might still encounter bugs, and the compiler might get
fixed in the meanwhile. Thus, you should write "around" compiler bugs only when
you are <span class="emphasis"><em>forced</em></span> to use a particular buggy
compiler.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Do not rely on automatic beautifiers. The main person who benefits from good
program style is the programmer him/herself, and especially in the early design
of handwritten algorithms or pseudo-code. Automatic beautifiers can only be
applied to complete, syntactically correct programs and hence are not available
when the need for attention to white space and indentation is greatest.
Programmers can do a better job of making clear the complete visual layout of a
function or file, with the normal attention to detail of a careful programmer.
(In other words, some of the visual layout is dictated by intent rather than
syntax and beautifiers cannot read minds.) Sloppy programmers should learn to
be careful programmers instead of relying on a beautifier to make their code
readable.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Accidental omission of the second "<code class="literal">=</code>" of the
logical compare is a problem. Use explicit tests. Avoid assignment with
implicit test.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   abool = bbool;
   if (abool) { ...
</pre>When embedded assignment <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> used,
make the test explicit so that it doesn't get "fixed" later.
<pre class="programlisting">
   while ((abool = bbool) != FALSE) { ...
</pre>
<pre class="programlisting">
   while (abool = bbool) { ... /* VALUSED */
</pre>
<pre class="programlisting">
   while (abool = bbool, abool) { ...
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Explicitly comment variables that are changed out of the normal control
flow, or other code that is likely to break during maintenance.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Modern compilers will put variables in registers automatically. Use the
<span class="emphasis"><em>register</em></span> sparingly to indicate the
variables that you think are most critical. In extreme cases, mark the 2-4 most
critical values as <code class="literal">register</code> and mark the rest as
<code class="literal">REGISTER.</code> The latter can be #defined to
<code class="literal">register</code> on those machines with many
registers.</p>

<h3 class="title"><a name="N109BD" id="N109BD"></a>Lint</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Lint</em></span> is a C program checker [2][11]
that examines C source files to detect and report type incompatibilities,
inconsistencies between function definitions and calls, potential program bugs,
etc. The use of <span class="emphasis"><em>lint</em></span> on all programs is
strongly recommended, and it is expected that most projects will require
programs to use <span class="emphasis"><em>lint</em></span> as part of the
official acceptance procedure.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the best way to use <span class=
"emphasis"><em>lint</em></span> is not as a barrier that must be overcome
before official acceptance of a program, but rather as a tool to use during and
after changes or additions to the code. <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Lint</em></span> can find obscure bugs and insure portability
before problems occur. Many messages from <span class=

But the program dumped core every time an ordinary user made a mistake on the
