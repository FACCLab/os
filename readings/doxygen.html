			<h2>Introduction</h2>
		</a>
		<p>
			Throught this course you will be working on big software projects
			and an important part of any large project is documentation.
			Documentation is especially important in group projects, like many of
			the projects in this class.  Imagine how useful a browsable index
			will be when your partner is asleep and you're trying to figure out
			his/her code. In order to ensure that your source code has adequate
			documentation, we will be requiring that your code be fully documented
			using doxygen, a documentation system for C similar to JavaDoc.  This
			document serves as a brief overview of doxygen and the features you
			will use on a regular basis.  For a more detailed description of
			doxygen and all of its features visit the
			<a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">doxygen homepage</a>.
			You can get detailed documentation and information about compiling and
			installing doxygen on a home system.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			There are two types of comments we want in your code.  The first kind
			are comments at the beginning of each file which describes
			the file and lists things like author and known bugs.  The
			second kind of comments are those that describe your functions and
			data structures.  We want you to put comments on all your functions
			and data structures.  You do not have to comment individual variable
			instances but are welcome to if you'd like.  The rest of this
			document talks about the doxygen commands that you need for each of
			the two kinds.  First, we'll describe what we expect to see and then
			talk about the specific commands that you need to use including
			simple examples.  Lastly there will be a larger example showing all
			of commands together.
		</p>
		
		<a name="files">
			<h2>Comments for Files</h2>
		</a>
		<p>
			Each file needs to begin with the <a href="#commands"><b>@file</b></a>
			command stating the name of the file.  This should be followed by a
			brief description of the file using the
			<a href="#commands"><b>@brief</b></a> command.  If necessary, you can
			follow this with a more detailed description.  Next you should
			put your name and andrew id, along with your partners name and andrew
			id, using the <a href="#commands"><b>@author</b></a> tag.  This needs
			to be followed with a bugs section with a list of known bugs using
			the <a href="#commands"><b>@bug</b></a> command.  If there are no known
			bugs, explicitly state that using the
			<a href="#commands"><b>@bug</b></a> command. 
		</p>
		
		<a name="functions">
			<h2>Comments for Functions and Data Structures</h2>
		</a>
		<p>
			Before each function, data structure, and macro you should put a
			comment block giving at least a brief description using the
			<b><a href="#commands">@brief</a></b> command. A brief description
			will suffice for your data structures but for you macros and
			functions you will need to use a few more commands.  After your
			description, you should use the <b><a href="#commands">@param</a></b>
			command to describe all of the parameters to your function. These
			descriptions should be followed by a description of the return value
			using the <b><a href="#commands">@return</a></b> command. Note: When
         we say "each" function, that is not a strong statement.  You can 
         leave out simple helper functions, like a max() macro, so you
         don't waste time.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			You can choose to comment your functions either in the header files
			where they are declared, in the source files where they are implemented
			or both. This is a matter of taste.  If you put it in the header file,
         like in the example, then you should be sure to remember to update the
         comments with the latest details of the implemenation. If you choose to
		   put the comments in both places note that if there is a difference between
		   the two sets of comments, the block at the declaration will superceed the
			one at the implementation. The long and short of this is that you should
         <strong>not</strong> put the comments in both.  For assembly files, you
		   can put the comments in the header file where they are declared.
		</p>

      <p>
         Here is what we expect to see in the non-brief section of the function:

         <ul>
           <li>
             Anything a user needs to know to decide whether this is the right
             function for them to use for a given job.
           </li>
           <li>
             Usage preconditions: must be called with interrupts disabled, etc.
           </li>
           <li>
		       Any use of an unusual algorithm (in which case, cite it -- academic
             format or page title and URL)
           </li>
           <li>
             Why the code was written in a non-obvious structure.
           </li>
           <li>
             Warnings about how to extend the function without breaking it.
           </li>
         </ul>

         Not all of that will be needed for every function.  Just make sure it
         is enough to make it clear what the function does and how it does it.
         Don't worry to much about this documentation stuff.  If we feel that it
         is not up to what we want, we'll let you know with your grade report
         and probably won't take points off right now, but may in future projects.
         Make sure that the documentation is there and that it makes sense.
      </p>

	      <h2>Coding Style / Coding Standards</h2>
      </a>

      <p>
         At some point in your career you may well be required, or at least
		   expected to adhere to an explicit coding standard document.  If you
		   are ever present at the inception of a large project, you will have
		   the opportunity to watch the inevitable flame war over tab stops
		   and brace placement.  Don't worry--for 15-410, we aren't going to
		   tie you down that much.
      </p>

      <p>
		   However, you should use a consistent and defensible style.  It
		   would probably be a good experience for you to read a few
		   coding style documents to see how they differ and how you feel
		   about the differences.  When you begin work with your partner
		   on Project 2 you will have an opportunity to discuss this issue.
		   We won't require the two of you to use exactly the same style,
		   but it would probably make sense for style to not vary wildly
		   within a single file.  For open source projects (i.e., potentially
		   many authors over many years), one popular approach is for the
		   "primary author" of each file to set the style (within reason) and
		   other developers to try to emulate that style (again, within
		   reason, but it really is good form for any change you suggest
		   to blend in with the code that's already there).
      </p>

      <p><a name="style" />
		   Here are some coding style documents you may find useful.
		   This purports to be a (the?)
		   <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle">Linux
		   kernel coding style</a> document.
		   To the eyes of an
		   old BSD hand, this looks a little cavalier, which is unsurprising.
		   The BSD
		   <a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/share/misc/style?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup">Kernel Normal Form (KNF)</a> is also
		   worth a look.
		   Many moons ago C programmers inside AT&amp;T put together the
		   Indian Hill C Style guide, which has been updated to yield
		   a generically titled
		   <A HREF="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/lab/cplus/cstyle.html">Recommended
		   C Style and Coding Standards</A> guide.
		   Here are <A HREF="https://code.google.com/p/google-styleguide/">Style guides for Google-originated open-source projects</A>, and
		   here are <A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/%7Emccann/style_c.html">Lester McCann's suggestions "Toward Developing Good Programming Style"</A>.
		   Of course, they contradict each other and probably
		   every other coding style document on the planet, but you shouldn't
		   let that bother you, and you should be able to detect a common core.
      </p>

      <p>
		   You may also wish to consult
		   <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20150607222648/http://di002.edv.uniovi.es/~cernuda/noprog_ENG.html">
		   How <EM>NOT</EM> to go about a programming assignment</A>
		   by Agust&#237;n Cernuda del R&#237;o.
      </p>

      <p>
		   What really matters is:
		   <dl>
		      <dt>Modularity</dt>
		        <dd>
		          The scheduler functions are in a file full
		          of scheduler functions and nothing else; each function is
		          coded up once; etc.
		        </dd>

		      <dt>Documentation</dt>
		        <dd>
		          This can be read at multiple levels.  For
		          example, people can read a short file to find out if
		          your program is right for them; can read about a
		          module or package to see if they want to steal it for
		          their own programs; can read about a function to
		          decide whether they need to read the code, etc.
     	                </dd>


		      <dt>Maintainability</dt>
		        <dd>
		          Including basic things such as
		          <strong>essentially never</strong> putting a hardwired
		          constant such as <tt>1128</tt> into a file, and
		          <strong>never</strong> using it twice, and
		          <strong>never ever</strong> putting <tt>1127</tt> into
		          your code because it's 1128 - 1. But you knew all that
		          from 15-213, right?  Since you asked, the right way to
		          handle 1128 would be
		          <br>
		          <tt>
		             (GREY << COLOR_SHIFT) | (ELEPHANT << ANIMAL_SHIFT) | 16 /* tons */
		          </tt>
		          <br>
              </dd>
			
		     <dt>Dead Code</dt>
		       <dd>
			     There are two very different kinds of "dead code" which
				 students tend to turn in.
			  One kind is 'debug code' which was briefly useful but never will
			  be again, stuff like <br>
			   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code> // printf("!!!! joe = %d\n", 4 * i / 0);</code>
			  <br>or<br>
			    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>int threadstatus = THR_RUNNING; // THR_RUNNING|128</code>
			  <br>or<br>
			    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code> // if (threadid ==17) MAGIC_BREAK;</code>

			  <br><br>Realistically, even if something like that helped you track down
			  a bug once, you wouldn't re-activate it to find the next one.
			  Since this code will never be run again, leaving it around can't
			  do anything except distract and slow down your audience.  Don't
			  turn it in.

			  <br>In the other direction, occasional assert()s are fine.  In fact,
			  sensibly done, they actually help document the code. See the section 
			  on asserts.

			  <br>Overall, if debug code is genuinely likely to be useful to readers
			  or maintainers, that argues in favor of keeping it, but the vast
			  majority of what gets stuck in temporarily is just noise, and should be
			  deleted.
                          <br>
              </dd>

		  <dt>Asserts</dt>
			<dd>
			  Asserts are statements that check that the assumptions that were made in 
			  your program are not violated. For example, let's say you have a variable 
			  <code>*nodeptr</code>. If, by design, <code>nodeptr</code> can never point 
			  to <code>NULL</code>, then a statement like
	   		  <br><code>ASSERT (nodeptr);</code><br>
			  or, in the Linux idiom,
	   		  <br><code>if (!nodeptr)<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BUG();<br></code><br>
			  is a way of verifying that this assumption is not violated. This is useful in 
			  two ways. Firstly, it documents your assumption. Secondly, in future, if anyone 
			  modifying your code violates this assumption, (s)he is informed of this early, 
			  rather than having to discover this through a debugging session. 
			  
  			  Hardcore performance evangelists will argue that such code will almost never be 
			  executed, and that the extra conditional statement just serves to affect the branch 
			  prediction accuracy. People with such concerns should look at the 
			  <a href="http://lxr.linux.no/source/include/linux/compiler.h#L60"><code>likely()</code>
			  and <code>unlikely()</code></a> preprocessor macros in the Linux kernel and the associated 
			  gcc builtin function <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html">
			  <code>__builtin_expect()</code></a>.
			  However, people who <EM>don't</EM> have measurable performance
			  problems should probably avoid littering their code with cryptic
			  incantations without actual benefit.
